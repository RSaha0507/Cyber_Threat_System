# 🛡️ Cyber Threat Intelligence & Response System (CTIRS)

A real-time, modular cybersecurity monitoring and response platform developed in Python.  
It ingests threat feeds, detects anomalies using intelligent models, visualizes threats through a live dashboard, and sets the foundation for automated incident response.

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🔄 **Live Threat Feed Aggregation**  
  Pulls real-time indicators of compromise (IoCs) from platforms like AlienVault OTX (with plans for AbuseIPDB, GreyNoise, etc.).

- 🧠 **Anomaly Detection Engine** *(Modular)*  
  Supports Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, and LOF for identifying suspicious patterns in threat data.

- 📊 **Real-Time Dashboard with Streamlit**  
  Clean and dynamic UI showing threat summaries, anomaly flags, and performance metrics.

- 🚨 **Alert & Logging Framework**  
  Planned integration for alerting (email/Slack) and incident response logging.

- 🔍 **Extensible Design**  
  Fully modular architecture for integrating new feeds, models, and response strategies.

- 🔐 **SPIN-based Formal Verification** *(Planned)*  
  Intended use of model checking to verify state transitions and system logic.
