# 🛡️ Cyber Threat Intelligence & Response System

This project is a real-time cybersecurity threat monitoring platform built entirely in Python.  
It simulates threat feed ingestion, detects anomalies, triggers alerts, and provides a response dashboard.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔄 Simulated Threat Feed Aggregation
- 📊 Streamlit-based Real-time Dashboard
- 🧠 Anomaly Detection Engine (coming up)
- 🚨 Alert System (via dashboard)
- 📝 Incident Response Logging (coming up)
- ✅ Formal Verification using SPIN (planned)

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- MongoDB (NoSQL database)
- Streamlit (frontend UI)
- PyMongo (database driver)
- Pandas (data handling)
- Scikit-learn / PyOD (for anomaly detection - later)
